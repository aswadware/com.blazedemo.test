# com.blazedemo.test
This repository contains the test automation code for the BlazeDemo application, a simple travel agency website. The code uses Maven, Java, Selenium, and TestNG to implement the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. 
The test cases cover the following scenarios:

Checking the title of the home page
Clicking on the destination link and checking the URL
Purchasing a ticket with parameterized data
The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It also includes comments and annotations to explain the logic and functionality of each class and method. The code can be executed using any IDE that supports Java and Maven, or using the command line. The test results can be viewed in the TestNG reports.
